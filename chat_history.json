This should include date, time, location, and container size (20' or 40').\n*   **Delivery Details:** A detailed screen for each delivery, showing customer information, exact delivery address, special instructions, and a map integration for easy navigation.\n*   **Status Updates:** Functionality for drivers to update the status of their deliveries (e.g., \"En route,\" \"Arrived,\" \"Delivered,\" \"Delayed\") with optional notes.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f9f9f9` (Light gray for a clean interface)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#2962ff` (A vibrant blue for primary actions and buttons)\n    *   Secondary: `#4caf50` (A calming green for secondary actions)\n    *   Accent: `#ffca28` (A bright yellow for highlights and important notifications)\n    *   Card: `#ffffff` (White for cards and containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#bbdefb` (A light blue for highlighting selected items)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" (default for each platform) for optimal readability.\n\nNow, let's create a plan to implement these features.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Create a `Delivery` component:** This component will display the details of a single delivery. It will receive delivery data as props.\n2.  **Modify the `HomeScreen`:**\n    *   Fetch delivery data (initially, this can be dummy data).\n    *   Display the deliveries in a FlatList or similar component, using the `Delivery` component for each item.\n    *   Implement basic status update functionality (e.g., a button to mark a delivery as \"Delivered\").\n3.  **Create a `DeliveryDetails` screen:**\n    *   This screen will display all the details of a selected delivery.\n    *   It will include customer information, address, instructions, and a map (using a library like `react-native-maps` or linking to the device's map app).\n4.  **Implement Navigation:**\n    *   Make each delivery item on the `HomeScreen` tappable, navigating the user to the `DeliveryDetails` screen when pressed.\n5.  **Implement Status Updates:**\n    *   Add a status update component to the `DeliveryDetails` screen.\n    *   Allow drivers to select a status from a list (e.g., \"En route,\" \"Arrived,\" \"Delivered,\" \"Delayed\").\n    *   Include a text input for adding notes.\n\nAfter implementing the plan, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-09T20:11:38.848347"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a delivery scheduler mobile app for your truck drivers.

Filter Toggle Button**\n- Added a filter icon button in the header (next to the add delivery button)\n- The icon changes appearance when the filter is active (filled vs outline)\n- Background highlight when filter is enabled\n\n**2. Filter Functionality**\n- Drivers can now filter deliveries to show only their own assignments\n- Uses a mock current driver ID (`driver1` - Mike Johnson) for demonstration\n- In production, this would come from your authentication system\n\n**3. Visual Feedback**\n- Filter status banner appears when filtering is active, showing the driver's name\n- \"Show All\" button in the banner to quickly disable the filter\n- Alert notifications when toggling the filter on/off\n- Updated statistics reflect only filtered deliveries\n\n**4. Smart Empty States**\n- Different messages when no deliveries are found based on filter state\n- \"You have no deliveries\" vs \"No deliveries scheduled\"\n\n**5. Information Card**\n- Added a helpful info card explaining the filter feature when it's not active\n- Guides users on how to use the filter\n\n### How It Works:\n\n- **Filter Off**: Shows all deliveries from all drivers (6 total in mock data)\n- **Filter On**: Shows only deliveries assigned to the current driver (3 deliveries for Mike Johnson)\n- Statistics update dynamically based on the filtered view\n- Console logs track filter state changes for debugging\n\n### Next Steps for Production:\n\nTo make this production-ready, you would:\n1. Replace `CURRENT_DRIVER_ID` and `CURRENT_DRIVER_NAME` with actual authenticated user data\n2. Store deliveries in Supabase database\n3. Implement RLS policies so drivers can only see their assigned deliveries by default\n4.
