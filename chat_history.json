This should include date, time, location, and container size (20' or 40').\n*   **Delivery Details:** A detailed screen for each delivery, showing customer information, exact delivery address, special instructions, and a map integration for easy navigation.\n*   **Status Updates:** Functionality for drivers to update the status of their deliveries (e.g., \"En route,\" \"Arrived,\" \"Delivered,\" \"Delayed\") with optional notes.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f9f9f9` (Light gray for a clean interface)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#2962ff` (A vibrant blue for primary actions and buttons)\n    *   Secondary: `#4caf50` (A calming green for secondary actions)\n    *   Accent: `#ffca28` (A bright yellow for highlights and important notifications)\n    *   Card: `#ffffff` (White for cards and containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#bbdefb` (A light blue for highlighting selected items)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" (default for each platform) for optimal readability.\n\nNow, let's create a plan to implement these features.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Create a `Delivery` component:** This component will display the details of a single delivery. It will receive delivery data as props.\n2.  **Modify the `HomeScreen`:**\n    *   Fetch delivery data (initially, this can be dummy data).\n    *   Display the deliveries in a FlatList or similar component, using the `Delivery` component for each item.\n    *   Implement basic status update functionality (e.g., a button to mark a delivery as \"Delivered\").\n3.  **Create a `DeliveryDetails` screen:**\n    *   This screen will display all the details of a selected delivery.\n    *   It will include customer information, address, instructions, and a map (using a library like `react-native-maps` or linking to the device's map app).\n4.  **Implement Navigation:**\n    *   Make each delivery item on the `HomeScreen` tappable, navigating the user to the `DeliveryDetails` screen when pressed.\n5.  **Implement Status Updates:**\n    *   Add a status update component to the `DeliveryDetails` screen.\n    *   Allow drivers to select a status from a list (e.g., \"En route,\" \"Arrived,\" \"Delivered,\" \"Delayed\").\n    *   Include a text input for adding notes.\n\nAfter implementing the plan, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-09T20:11:38.848347"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a delivery scheduler mobile app for your truck drivers.

I've successfully added the Spaces Storage group logo to your delivery scheduler app. Here's what I implemented:\n\n## Changes Made:\n\n### 1. **Created SpacesStorageLogo Component** (`components/SpacesStorageLogo.tsx`)\n- A reusable logo component using Expo Image\n- Three size options: small (80x32), medium (120x48), large (160x64)\n- Uses a professional storage/logistics image from Unsplash as placeholder\n- Includes proper accessibility support and smooth loading transitions\n- BlurHash placeholder for better loading experience\n\n### 2. **Updated Home Screen** (`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`)\n- Added company logo header at the top of the screen\n- Included a professional tagline: \"Professional Container Delivery Services\"\n- Logo appears prominently before the delivery schedule\n- Maintains all existing functionality\n\n### 3. **Updated Profile Screen** (`app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`)\n- Added company branding section at the top\n- Shows the Spaces Storage Group logo in large size\n- Displays company name and service area\n- Creates a professional company identity throughout the app\n\n## Key Features:\n\n- **Professional Branding**: The logo establishes Spaces Storage Group as the company identity\n- **Consistent Design**: Logo integrates seamlessly with your existing color scheme and design\n- **Responsive Sizing**: Different logo sizes for different contexts\n- **Performance Optimized**: Uses Expo Image for efficient loading and caching\n- **Accessibility**: Proper alt text and screen reader support\n\nThe logo now appears in two key locations:\n1. **Home Screen**: Medium-sized logo with tagline at the top\n2. **Profile Screen**: Large logo with full company branding\n\nThe image I used is a professional storage/logistics facility that represents your container delivery business well. If you have your actual Spaces Storage Group logo file, you can easily replace the URL in the `SpacesStorageLogo.tsx` component with your real logo image.\n\nThe app now has a strong company identity while maintaining all the delivery scheduling functionality you had before!"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": "c0f090a95d8ef98ec7de09f346da006a9b1e6750", "message": "feat: Add Spaces Storage Group logo to home and profile screens\n", "timestamp": "2025-10-10T12:13:21Z", "files_changed": ["app/(tabs)/profile.tsx", "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "components/SpacesStorageLogo.tsx"], "update_number": 4, "parent_commit_id": "919668b3089417cc1aa0b675afcf76dfccf86892"}], "timestamp": "2025-10-10T12:09:54Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Add Spaces Storage Group logo to home and profile screens\nOnce this has been done can you add an option to opt for either sales or rental as we deliver both options with the same drivers "}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I understand.
